# Singa Fare Calculation System

This project is a fare calculation system that processes public transportation trips for users, applies daily and weekly fare caps, and tracks total fares. It also provides a summary indicating whether a user has hit their daily or weekly cap.

## Features

- **Daily and Weekly Fare Caps**: Automatically caps fares based on predefined daily and weekly limits for different routes.
- **Peak and Non-Peak Fare Calculation**: Calculates fares based on peak and non-peak hours for each route.
- **User Fare Tracking**: Tracks fares for multiple users across different routes.
- **Cap Status**: Displays whether users have hit their daily or weekly fare caps.
